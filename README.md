# Features

1. Draggable Items: Only the middle item in the carousel is draggable.

2. Dynamic Transformations: Items resize, reposition, and change opacity dynamically while dragging.

3. Reset and Animation: When dragging ends, the items either move up, move down, or reset to their original positions.

4. Class-Based Updates: CSS classes are dynamically applied to represent the current state of items (top, middle, bottom).
